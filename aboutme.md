My name is *Simone Azeglio*. I am a physicist by training, currently pursuing a M.Sc. in Physics of Complex Systems at the *University of Turin* (Italy) and I am also a Visiting Research Student - working on Neuroscience - at the *University of Ottawa* (Canada). My main interest lies in understanding the **Learning Process** from two different perspectives: biological and artificial. That's why I've decided to found the *Machine Learning Journal Club (**MLJC**)*, a non-profit organization which aims to fill the gap between students and researchers in Machine & Deep Learning related fields. 

### Why SAZIO? 
Well, mainly because it's a way to encode my name and surname, **S**imone **AZ**egl**IO**, but there's something more: *"sazio"* means *"full"* in Italian, in the sense that you satisfied your hunger. The ladder is the motivation behind this whole blog: explaining stuff and creating contents in order to fulfill the hunger for knowledge - in scientific terms - that wanders on top of us all.
